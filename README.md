  

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify water body images as clean or polluted, supporting sustainability and environmental monitoring.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Collect and preprocess images of clean and polluted water bodies  
- Perform EDA and image augmentation  
- Train a CNN model to detect pollution levels  
- Evaluate and visualize model accuracy  

## ðŸ§  Week 1 Progress
- Defined the project problem statement  
- Collected and organized image dataset  
- Preprocessed data using Keras ImageDataGenerator  
- Visualized sample images and prepared data for training  

## ðŸ›  Tools
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy
